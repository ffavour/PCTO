In our game, the player must move around the screen using a cursor that detects the hand and try to "catch" the various squares that appear within the "music sheet".
With an open hand, the cursor is released so it does not perform any action but can move freely within the game screen, while with a clenched fist, the cursor is in selection mode and therefore positioned on a key/button it presses it.

**How can it help MS patients?**

The game was mainly developed to train cognitive functions such as attention and concentration through the stimulus-gesture association, the patient will have to recognize where the rectangles will appear on the screen and move the arm and/or open or close the hand accordingly. In this way, a dual-task rehabilitation exercise is also performed in which the motor task to be performed is the movement of the arm and the opening and closing of the hand, while the cognitive task is to recognize where the rectangles appear and therefore, where to move the arm and/or close the hand
